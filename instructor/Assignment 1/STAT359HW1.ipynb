    "## Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors are a fundamental building block in NLP. They are used directly in many downstream tasks (e.g., classification, retrieval, and translation) and serve as inputs to sequence models—from early RNNs to modern Transformer-based LLMs. Because of this, it’s important to build intuition about their strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore two families of word vectors: **count-based vectors** derived from *co-occurrence matrices*, and **GloVe**, which learns embeddings from global co-occurrence statistics using a training objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Terminology:** The terms \"word vectors\" and \"word embeddings\" are often used interchangeably. The term \"embedding\" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) states, \"*conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension*\"."

    "Many word vector approaches rely on the intuition that **semantically similar words** tend to appear in **similar contexts**. As a result, such words often **co-occur with overlapping sets of neighboring words**. By examining these co-occurrence patterns, we can learn vector representations (embeddings) that capture aspects of meaning.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **co-occurrence matrix** counts how often tokens appear near each other. Suppose a token $w_i$ appears at position $i$ in a document. With a fixed **window size** $n$, the *context* of $w_i$ consists of the $n$ tokens immediately to the left and the $n$ tokens immediately to the right:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{i-n},\\dots,w_{i-1},\\; w_{i+1},\\dots,w_{i+n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We build a word-by-word matrix $M$ where $M_{ij}$ is the number of times word $w_j$ appears in the context window of word $w_i$ (summed over the whole corpus). Many implementations make $M$ **symmetric** by counting co-occurrences in both directions; in that case $M_{ij}=M_{ji}$.\n",

    "### Distance Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row (or column) of $M$ can be viewed as a **count-based word vector**, but these vectors are typically very high-dimensional. A simple improvement is to use **distance weighting**: words that appear closer together in the window receive higher weights than those farther apart. We use the weight $w(d) = \\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the distance between the center word and context word. This captures the intuition that immediate neighbors are more semantically relevant than distant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PPMI Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "With large corpora, high-frequency words and common function words (like \"the\", \"and\") may dominate the raw co-occurrence counts, obscuring meaningful semantic relationships. **Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI)** addresses this by measuring whether two words co-occur more often than expected by chance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{PMI}(w_i, w_j) = \\log \\frac{P(w_i, w_j)}{P(w_i) \\cdot P(w_j)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(w_i, w_j)$ is the joint probability of the two words appearing together, and $P(w_i)$, $P(w_j)$ are their individual probabilities. PPMI takes the positive part: $\\text{PPMI}(w_i, w_j) = \\max(0, \\text{PMI}(w_i, w_j))$. This transformation reduces the influence of frequent but uninformative co-occurrences while preserving meaningful associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to reduce dimensionality is **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** (closely related to PCA). In practice, we often keep only the top $k$ components (e.g., via truncated SVD) to obtain shorter vectors that capture the most important patterns in co-occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SVD Decomposition](imgs/svd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection doesn't create meaning—it can reveal structure that's already present in the data. After dimensionality reduction, words that appear in similar contexts (e.g., *doctor* and *hospital*) tend to be closer to each other than unrelated words (e.g., *doctor* and *dog*).\n",
    "\n",
    "If eigenvalues and SVD are new to you, [here](https://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf) is a beginner-friendly introduction. In practice, you will typically use library implementations (NumPy/SciPy/scikit-learn). On large corpora, computing a full SVD can be expensive, so we use **truncated** methods (like `TruncatedSVD`) to efficiently extract the top $k$ components."

This is bizarre because not only does it suggest that women's association with aspiration is different than men's, it practically suggests that there are no significant associations with aspiration for women beyond the clinical context. <br/>\n",
